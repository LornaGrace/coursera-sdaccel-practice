# Developing FPGA-accelerated cloud applications with SDAccel: Practice - Course Material

## Introduction
This repository hosts the source codes used during the Coursera course titled "Developing FPGA-accelerated cloud applications with SDAccel: Practice"

## Software Requirements
All this codes have been tested using Xilinx SDAccel 2017.2 on a Linux Machine. It is not guaranteed software functionality with later versions of the tool.

## Folder Structure
Each folder is organized following the organization of the specialization course in Coursera.
There is a week number, that containes multiple modules. Each module containes multiple lesson and each lesson presents multiple items.
For each item, we provide two versions of the code: the initial and final one.
The main organization is as follows:
``` 
|-- <week-number>
    |-- <module_number>_<module-name>
        |-- <lesson_number>_<lesson-name>
            |-- <item_number>_<item-name>
                |-- <final_code>
                |-- <initial_code>
```
